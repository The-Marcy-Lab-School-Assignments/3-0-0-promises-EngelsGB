# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

`Outside promise` prints first because it's synchronous code while `Inside promise` is a Promise object which is asynchronous. This means that while `Outside promise` will be printed inmediately because it doesn't take time to complete, `Inside promise` has to take its time before executing thus it prints later.
