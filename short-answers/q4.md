# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer

The arguments passed to `resolve/reject` are used as the Promise's value by the `then/catch` methods for functionality.

Your answer is on the right track, but it would be clearer if you specify that the arguments passed to resolve determine the value with which the promise is fulfilled, and the arguments passed to reject determine the reason for the promise's rejection, both of which are used by the then and catch methods respectively.
