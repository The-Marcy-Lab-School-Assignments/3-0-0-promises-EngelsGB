# Question

With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling _and_ returning them

# Answer

A, because the `resolve()` and `reject()` methods are to Promises what the return statement is to functions. These two methods give value to a Promise so that it's "complete".
